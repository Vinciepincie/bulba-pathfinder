  /**
   * ONE jump per rollout, then walk it in.
   *
   * Upstream holds jump for the whole rollout, which means a jump that lands
   * short does not fail the test — the sim simply jumps again from wherever it
   * came down and satisfies the node many ticks later, from a cell the planner
   * never routed through. The executor then commits to a take-off whose real
   * landing is somewhere else entirely: on 2b2t spawn the residual cross-axis
   * velocity of a 4-block drop-jump carried the next take-off two cells short
   * into a 1-block pit, and the rollout still said yes because it reached the
   * node 9 ticks after landing in that pit — where the bot then sat for the
   * rest of the run. Upstream's 20-tick budget hid this by accident; ours is
   * 45 so deep drops fit, so the rule has to be explicit.
   *
   * Releasing jump on touchdown is also just what the executor does: it
   * re-decides every tick, and after a landing nothing is holding jump unless
   * a fresh decision asks for one. So the rollout now answers the question
   * actually being asked — does ONE jump from here, plus the run-in, reach
   * the node? — and a landing short of the node fails it unless the bot can
   * walk the rest, which is a real landing rather than a bounce.
